** Page Replacement Algorithms Simulator | C

* Implemented a simulator for page replacement algorithms including Optimal, Least Frequently Used (LFU), Least Recently Used (LRU), and First In First Out (FIFO) in C.

* The simulator allows users to input a page reference string and the number of frames, displaying page hits, page faults, hit ratios, and fault rates for each algorithm.

* Utilized logic to handle replacement strategies with real-time page fault and hit tracking, improving understanding of memory management in operating systems.

* Focused on simulating realistic memory conditions and evaluating algorithm efficiency with multiple input configurations.
